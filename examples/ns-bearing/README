Corrected:
1.	STOKES forms were wrong.
2.	Newton solver did not reflect update of bc values, thus repeating every second time step
	  the previous solution. I tried to resolve that by projection, PLEASE CHECK it, I did that
	  without much understanding. 

Issues: 
1.	The pressure level is not fixed (eg. by prescribing its mean value over domain)
	  (this can possibly lead to other problems, since the pressure is not unique and the matrix is singular)
2.	I think that pressure integral is not correct (e.g. shift by constant should not change the integral)
3.	(tests: r1=0.6,eps=0.3,REFs=(2,2-iso)):
	STOKES, PRESSURE H1, NEWTON=true : 
		diverges completely after while...
		... this can be due to missing pressure level fix!
		... also it is WRONG that the diverged solution is claimed to be converged.
	-''-, NEWTON=false :
		converges well, but pressure is shifted.
	STOKES, PRESSURE L2, NEWTON=true/false :
		pressure oscillations (element-based), same order as pressure profile!
		(the pressure mean value does not shift from zero, but that is only a luck)
		NEWTON true/false give similar results (except for the pressure integral)
