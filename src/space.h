/// \brief Represents a finite element space over a domain.
///
/// The Space class represents a finite element space over a domain defined by 'mesh', spanned
/// by basis functions constructed using 'shapeset'. It serves as a base class for H1Space,
/// HcurlSpace and L2Space, since most of the functionality is common for all the spaces.
///
/// There are four main functions the Space class provides:
/// <ol>
///    <li> It handles the Dirichlet boundary conditions. The user sets a callback determining
///         which markers represent the Dirichlet part of the boundary (by returning BC_ESSENTIAL)
///         and which markers represent the Neumann and Newton parts (BC_NATURAL). It is also
///         possible to return the value BC_NONE, which supresses all BC processing on such part
///         of the boundary. The callback is set by the function set_bc_types().
///
///         On Dirichlet edges the Space class calls another callback, set by either of the two
///         functions set_essential_bc_values(). The obtained scalar values are projected onto the available
///         edge shape functions on each edge. This way the Dirichlet lift is obtained, which
///         matches as closely as possible the user-defined boundary data. Two kinds of value
///         callback functions are defined: the first provides the absolute coordinates on the edge
///         in question, while the second is supposed to return the Dirichlet value based on two
///         vertex indices and a parameter in the range [0,1], representing the position on the
///         edge. The user can set any one of the two callbacks, whichever suits her better. If
///         both are set, the "EdgePos" one takes precedence.
///
///         If one or more of the BC callbacks are not set, default ones are used. The default
///         BC type is BC_NATURAL for the whole boundary (see the function static int
///         default_bc_type(int marker) in space.cpp). The default BC value is zero for all
///         markers.
///
///    <li> It stores element polynomial degrees, or 'orders'. All active elements need to have
///         an order set for the Space to be valid. Individual orders can be set by calling
///         set_element_order(). You can also set the same order for all elements using
///         set_uniform_order(). Quadrilateral elements can have different orders in the vertical
///         and horizontal directions. It is therefore necessary to form the order using the macro
///         H2D_MAKE_QUAD_ORDER() when calling the aforementioned functions.
///
///    <li> It builds and enumerates the basis functions. After all element orders have been set,
///         you must call the function assign_dofs(). This function assigns the DOF (degree-of-
///         freedom) numbers to basis functions, starting with 'first_dof' (optional parameter).
///         It also determines constraining relationships in the mesh due to hanging nodes and
///         builds constrained basis functions. The total number of basis functions can then
///         be obtained by calling get_num_dofs(). Standard basis functions are assigned positive
///         numbers from 'first_dof' to ('first_dof' + (get_num_dofs() - 1) * 'stride'). All
///         shape functions belonging to the Dirichlet lift are assigned DOF number of -1. This
///         way the Dirichlet lift becomes a (virtual) basis function. This simplifies assembling.
///
///    <li> Finally, and most importantly, the Space is able to deliver a list of shape functions
///         existing on each element. Such a list is called an "assembly list" and is represented
///         by the class AsmList. The assembly list contains the triplets (idx, dof, coef).
///         'idx' is the shape function index, as understood by the Shapeset. 'dof' is the number
///         of the basis function, whose part the shape function forms. 'coef' is a real constant,
///         with which the shape function must be multiplied in order to fit into the basis
///         function. This is typically 1, but can be less than that for constrained functions.
///         Constrained vertex functions can belong to more than one basis functions. This
///         results in more triplets with the same 'idx'. However, the assembling procedure or
///         the Solution class do not have to worry about that. For instance, the Solution class
///         simply obtains the values of all shape functions contained in the list, multiplies them
///         by 'coef', and forms a linear combination of them by taking the solution vector values
///         at the 'dof' positions. This way the solution to the PDE is obtained.
/// </ol>
///
/// Space is an abstract class and cannot be instatiated. Use one of the specializations H1Space,
/// HcurlSpace or L2Space instead.
///
/// The handling of irregular meshes is desribed in H1Space and HcurlSpace.
///
