# This example shows how to run adaptive hp-FEM, h-FEM and p-FEM with
# basic control parameters. The underlying problem is a planar model
# of an electrostatic micromotor (MEMS). You may want to first run the model
# with hp-FEM (ADAPT_TYPE = 0), then with h-FEM (ADAPT_TYPE = 1), and
# last with p-FEM (ADAPT_TYPE = 2). The last option is there solely for
# completeness, since adaptive p-FEM is not really useful in practice.
# Uniform initial polynomial degree of mesh elements can be set using
# the variable P_INIT. The function adapt(...) takes the parameters THRESHOLD,
# STRATEGY, ADAPT_TYPE, ISO_ONLY, and MESH_REGULARITY whose meaning is
# explained below. Only the first parameter THRESHOLD is mandatory, all
# others can be left out and in that case default values are used.
# Additional control parameters are possible, these are demonstrated
# in the next tutorial example. Two types of convergence graphs are created
# -- error estimate wrt. the number of degrees of freedom (DOF), and error
# estimate wrt. CPU time. Later you will learn that also the error wrt.
# exact solution can be created for problems where exact solution is
# available. In this example you also can see how
# to define different material parameters in various parts of the
# computational domain.

#      eps_r = EPS2 in Omega_2 (moving part of the motor)

# BC: phi = 0 V on Gamma_1 (left edge and also the rest of the outer boundary
